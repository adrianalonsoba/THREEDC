# THREEDC API reference


#### Function Chain
As in dc.js, majority of THREEDC functions are designed to allow function chaining, meaning it will return the current chart instance
whenever it is appropriate. Therefore configuration of a chart can be written in the following style:
```js
chart.width(300)
     .height(300)
     .depth(0.9)
...
```
